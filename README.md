## Task
Use the Moment.js library to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## How it Works:

```
Each block represent the working hour from 9AM to 5PM.
Each block is color coded to indicate the past(gray), present(red), or future(green).
Each block comes with an input field for user to type in text.
Save button will store user input into localstorage, and will auto-load when user open website. 
This application uses jquery and moment.js, and Bootstrap.
